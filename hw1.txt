Objective: Implement a simple processor

Assignment:

Finish the implementation if a simple RISC processor:

- Words are 16 bits
- Memory addresses are 16-bit wide
- Memory is word-addressable (each word is 16 bits)
- It has a 16 bit PC
- It has 16 general purpose registers, each 16 bit wide
- It has fixed width 16 bit instructions

Three instructions are defined

encoding              instruction             description

0000iiiiiiiitttt      mov i,t                 regs[t] = i; pc + 1;
0001aaaabbbbtttt      add a,b,t               regs[t] = regs[a] + regs[b]; pc + 1;
0002jjjjjjjjjjjj      jmp j                   pc = j;


Files you can change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cpu.v contains the implementation

Files to leave alone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Makefile, test.ok, imem.hex

To compile
~~~~~~~~~~

    make



To run
~~~~~~

    make run

Will also produce cpu.vcd which can be viewed in gtkwave

To test
~~~~~~~

    make test
